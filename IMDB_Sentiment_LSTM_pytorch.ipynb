character depth and development, you will be craving mystery and unpredictability, you will demand dynamic camera work and incredible backdrops. sadly, you won't find all of these aspects together in one kung-fu movie, except for five deadly venoms!<br /><br />easily the best kung-fu movie of all-time, venoms blends a rich plot, full of twists and turns, with colourful (and developed) characters, along with some of the best camerawork to come out of the 70s. the success of someone liking the film depends on the viewers ability to decipher which character is which, and who specializes in what venom. one is the centipede, two is the snake, three is the scorpion, four is the lizard, and five is the toad. each character has different traits, characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. therein lies the hook, we learn along with the student character, finding out who these different men turn out to be. we are in his shoes (so to speak), and we have to pick who we trust, and who we don't, just like he does. we learn along with him.<br /><br />not only is the plot, the characters, and the camerawork great, it's also fun to watch, which in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other movie of it's kind. it's worth quite a few watches to pick up on everything that's going on. venoms is a lesson on what kung-fu can really do...just don't expect many other kung-fu films to live

into the easy jokes and has many less good moments. only the two women (uma and milian) are decent in their part. most of the film is done with histrionic character, excessively exaggerated (a little is ok, too much is disgusting) and the only one that one could save is the gay bodyguard, who, at least is coherent, the rest, are too much idiot. the most surprising thing is the fact that the movie

is, everybody has to start somewhere  even if it's not in the most astounding debut  and christopher nolan introduces himself to the world in 1998 with following.<br /><br />when watching it, i couldn't help but draw resemblances to another directorial debut, avant-garde auteur david lynch's eraserhead. following is not a surrealist psychological horror film in that sense, but the similarities are noticeable; most notable, it's shot in grainy black-and-white and has an atmosphere about it that makes it unique. it's hard to describe in words, but it loosely resembles the smoky atmosphere you'd find in the film noirs of old. hence, it can be said that following is a contemporary film noir, or a neo-noir. overall, it's an amalgamation of that and a psychological thriller, and the story is most appropriate to these two genres.<br /><br />the main character is nameless, and the movie's title stems from an early, obsessive-compulsive trait he possessed  randomly picking out people on the street and following them, sometimes even for hours on end. during one of these 'stalking expeditions', the main character becomes noticed by one of the people he is following, and is confronted. turns out that the 'confronter' is a man who is willing to befriend our narrator, and he introduces himself; his name is cobb, and he's a petty burglar who invites the narrator to follow him on his burglaries.<br /><br />from there, the main character becomes swept up in cobb's world, and he becomes embroiled in crime, passion and violence as he gets more and more intimate with cobb. following is not so much a character study, but instead a film which follows the tumultuous relationship between these two main characters, and the devastating ramifications it has on our narrator. nolan succeeds in making the film resemble a film noir, and emulates the respective atmosphere well.<br /><br />as a thriller, following is taut and atmospheric; however as a film in general, it's somewhat of a disappointment. if not that, then one could definitely call it underwhelming. the entire film is shot in a non-chronological and non-linear fashion, and it makes the story and film-experience unique, to some extent  this style has been done so many times now it's almost commonplace technique  and the story itself is unique to some extent.<br /><br />however, following is ultimately underwhelming for the entire film, and is disappointingly unspectacular. the story calls for more  more action, more suspense and more thrills  but it becomes too embroiled in its own storyline, and instead focuses on creating an intricate story. following does succeed in doing that, but without any other elements it's a film noir that doesn't quite work out; it's got a sense of emptiness which isn't enormous, but still noticeable nonetheless. furthermore, the film's shocking revelation at the end  almost a mandatory convention in film noirs  is one that makes us feel cheated; it's unpredictable and comes out of nowhere, but in relation to the story it's disappointing, as it essentially makes the preceding scenes, and the entire film, seem like an enormous waste of time.<br /><br />but the positives far outweigh the negatives, and in the end following turns out to be a flawed but satisfying film, yes, everybody has to start somewhere. christopher nolan does it with following, and he does it in a fine manner. a quiet, meek but fine manner. it's not the most astounding movie, and it isn't quite worthy of the accolades the director would go on to receive in the following decade, but it's still a good film nonetheless. when singling out following, you find a well-made, taut and atmospheric thriller, one which lacks noticeable nuance or innovative style but still manages to grip audiences nonetheless.\n","真實類別: 1\n","預測類別: 1\n","\n","dark angel is a cross between huxley's brave new world and percy's love in the ruins--portraying the not too distant future as a disturbing mixture of chaos and order, both in the worst sense of the word. once one swallows the premise that all modern technology can be brought to a standstill by \"the pulse,\" it provides an entertaining landscape for exploring the personalities of and relationships between the two primary characters--max (the dark angel/bike messenger) and logan (the rich rebel). it seems uneven, perhaps a result of a variety of authors, but is held together by the energetic, beautiful, and charming jessica alba, who seems both strong and calloused yet vulnerable and sensitive. i think that fox has done it again.\n","真實類別: 1\n","預測類別: 1\n","\n","this is the kind of movie that's so extremely bad that you cant stop watching it because you keep telling yourself that 'it cannot continue to be this crappy all the way to the end. it just cant'. you know, 'worse than jaws 4'-kind of bad.<br /><br />i honestly think i've only seen one movie that was worse than this, and then we're talking religious crap about how you'd end up in hell for lying or watching football.<br /><br />gore? indeed and lots of it. well made gore? no way.<br /><br />the acting is beyond bad and all the lines are lousy clichés. same goes for the storyline which only really consist of sex, blood and violence, like so many other gore movies.<br /><br />if you're hoping for a mix between ichi the killer and august underground keep looking. you wont find it in live feed.\n","真實類別: 0\n","預測類別: 0\n","\n","this film is brilliant...... without a doubt. watched it a while ago after constant pestering from family members who are right into their sci-fi films (which i am not), and thought it was quite good. but after recently watching a few documentaries on outer-space etc we watched it again... and it is good.<br /><br />kevin spacey is without doubt one of the greatest actors ever and i really like jeff bridges (big lewbowski, blown away, arlington road). the film revolves around a patient in a nursing home who claims he is from another planet. yeah right, you think... but what if his story is so believable that even his psychiatrist begins to wonder if he is telling the truth.<br /><br />that is how the story evolves with bridges going through all kinds of emotions dealing with prot (as he is known), his own psychiatric colleagues, his wife and family, his brother-in-law and his cosmologist astronomer work colleagues (who after getting some data from prot, pretty much admit that he might be telling the truth!) a great film... that get's you wondering.....<br /><br />8/10

space outfit \"like super cool\" with a \"like totally bitchin\" belt and stick on rhinestones on her face.<br /><br />but anyways, the movie is actually one of the few \"family\" movies that holds your interest. i know that the begining drags, particuarly if you know what is going to happen, but the second half is probably one of the most nerve wracking segments in a family film.<br /><br />i wouldn't stand up in front of millions of people and proclaim to love this movie, in fact renting it is pretty embarrassing itself, but i'll admit it here with the internet to hide behind.<br /><br
